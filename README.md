# Fast Flip! Token Tools

> [!NOTE]
> Fast Flip! is validated to work with V11 and V12 and no update is required. It is recommended that you disable animations when playing with systems other than Pathfinder 2e due to a bug in Foundry.

Foundry VTT addon that introduces a set of useful hotkeys and features for tokens.

Allows players to flip their own tokens and add an AFK status indicator to them using easy and configurable shortcuts.

GMs can also use the same set of shortcuts to mirror tiles.

## List of Shortcuts
* Pressing `F` will mirror the selected tokens and tiles horizontally
* Pressing `Shift+F` will mirror the selected tokens and tiles vertically
* Pressing `Shift+K` will toggle the AFK status of any selected tokens
* Pressing `Alt+S` will show a speech bubble with the token's name
